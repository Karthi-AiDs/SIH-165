## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

Ministry of Defence

## Idea

The AI-powered interview system for RAC will streamline recruitment and promotion evaluations using AI-driven question generation, automated candidate assessment, and expert-assisted scoring. It simulates a real-life boardroom interview, ensuring structured, relevant, and unbiased questioning. The system consists of an AI question generator, automated evaluation engine, expert review panel, and data analytics module, all integrated into a cloud-based infrastructure. Use cases include candidate simulation, AI-assisted interviewer support, candidate ranking, and performance analytics. The solution leverages technologies like React.js, Python, NLP models, and cloud platforms, ensuring scalability, security, and compliance. Dependencies include AI model training, cloud hosting, and expert validation. This system will improve efficiency, fairness, and data-driven decision-making in RAC interviews.

## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram

The system will integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to generate relevant interview questions, assess candidate responses, and provide quantitative scoring. The architecture consists of the following components:

1. User Interface: A web-based platform for interviewers and candidates.

2. AI Question Generator: NLP-based system to create questions based on candidate expertise.

3. Automated Evaluation Engine: AI-powered response analysis and scoring.

4. Expert Review Panel: Human evaluators for oversight and bias reduction.

5. Data Analytics Module: Insights and reporting for decision-making.

6. Cloud Storage & Processing: Secure, scalable infrastructure for data handling.

## Use Cases

### Candidate Interview Simulation

A candidate logs into the system and selects an interview category.

AI generates relevant ice-breaking, technical, and managerial questions.

Candidate responds in real-time, and AI evaluates their answers.

#### 1. AI-Assisted Interviewer Support:

Experts use AI-generated questions or modify them as needed.

AI suggests scoring based on predefined benchmarks.

Interviewers validate AI-assigned scores and provide final evaluation.

#### 2. Candidate Scoring & Ranking:

AI provides real-time assessment and scoring.

System ranks candidates based on technical knowledge, response relevance, and managerial skills.

Final reports assist in decision-making for recruitment and promotion.

#### 3. Performance Analytics & Insights:

Generates detailed candidate performance reports.

Identifies strong and weak areas for future training.

Helps refine interview questions and assessment criteria.
